#### Experience

-----

##### Life Story Network

*May 2003 - Present*

- Developed an in-house tool to streamline production from creation to completion.
	- A Windows desktop app written to interpret text scripts to execute generalized functions (copy, delete, move, rename, directory listing, shell commands, file modification, etc.) and other more production specific functions defined within the app.
	- While each desktop app was installed locally, the scripts were located remotely which provided an easily modifiable system of automation commands and logic with hash-based file integrity checking for a layer of security to prevent tampering.
	- The desktop app communicated with an API which provided production work data. This data was then parsed and displayed in an interactive spreadsheet-like interface with views taylored to specific departments. The app also sent API commands to update the database as production items were assigned, completed, and other status changes.
	- Communicated with other apps used in production (Adobe) to perform actions and/or exports through shell commands and/or run-time generated ExtendScript files.
- Developed other in-house tools and prototypes using Javascript, React, Python and C++.
	- A command line tool written in C++ to:
		- Scan a directory tree and return the file and folder structure.
		- Copy all files and folders from a path to a destination, optionally copying only files and / or folders that match a RegEx while updating the command-line output with the progress.
		- List all files in a path with their hash.
		- Generate JSON for all output providing easy parsing in the calling app.
	- A Windows app written in C# to aid in positioning (translating, rotating, scaling) photos in a layout or multiple layouts, optionally adding border and corner decorations. The app will then export the placed photo or photo layout to their specific placeholder images, later to be used as textures in a 3D rendered scene.
- Video editor - creating Life Story Digital Films for funerals.
	- Editing a Lifestory(R) for length.
	- Arranging photos to go along with the Lifestory as much as possible in the editors timeline.
	- Adding stock music tracks and stock video or animation as needed then exporting final product for upload.
- Shot video and created 3D animated stock footage for backgrounds and b-roll in videos.
- Product photography (folders, cards, books, DVDs) using various lighting setups (soft-boxes, gels, diffusers).
- Shot and edited groups of people in staged scenes for use in product marketing.
